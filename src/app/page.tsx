                Preotu earned his Grandmaster title in 2016, becoming the second youngest Canadian-born GM. Some of his top achievements include
                getting first at the 2016 Calgary International, tying for first at the 2017 Canadian Open Master, getting first at the 2018 Quebec Open,
                and being the top Canadian scorer at the 2022 and 2024 Chess Olympiad."
